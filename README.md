README: Steganography

Introduction

Steganography is the practice of concealing information within digital media such as images, audio, or video files. Unlike cryptography, which scrambles data to make it unreadable, steganography hides the existence of the data itself, making it difficult to detect. This technique is widely used for secure communication, digital watermarking, and data protection.

Features

Data Hiding: Embed text, files, or messages within images, audio, or other digital media.

Encryption Support: Secure the hidden data using encryption before embedding.

Invisibility: Ensures minimal visual or perceptible distortion to the carrier file

Robustness: Resistant to common operations such as compression and minor alterations.

Multiple Carrier Formats: Supports various file types, including PNG, JPEG, WAV, and MP4.

Detection Resistance: Designed to resist steganalysis techniques used to detect hidden data.

Installation

To install and use a basic steganography tool in Python, follow these steps:

Python 3, pip install 

Applications

Digital Watermarking: Protect intellectual property by embedding invisible watermarks.

Secure Communication: Hide messages in images or audio files for private transmission.

Covert Operations: Used by journalists and whistleblowers to transmit sensitive information securely.

Data Protection: Conceal sensitive data within media files to prevent unauthorized access.
